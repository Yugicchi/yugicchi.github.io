# Hello!

This is the main repository for my web project. It contains all files and folders for assets like stylesheets and posts.  
This `README.md` will provide the information such as [Project Structure](#project-structure), [License](#license), and the [things that need to be done](#to-do-list).  
I'll try to make progress each week :D<br><br>
